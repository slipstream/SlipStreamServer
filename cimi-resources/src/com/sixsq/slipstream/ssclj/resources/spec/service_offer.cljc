;; For compute resources (VMs) the name of the connector must be connector document
;; id WITHOUT the 'connector/' prefix.  Changing this requires changes in much of
;; the downstream deployment code.
;;
;; For data resources, it is preferable to use the standard, full connector document
;; id.
;;
;; This schema now permits both, although the long-term goal should be a migration
;; towards the standard, full connector document id.
