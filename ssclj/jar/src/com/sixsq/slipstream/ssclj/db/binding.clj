(defprotocol Binding
  "This protocol defines the core interface to the underlying database.
   All of the functions accept and return native clojure data structures.
   The functions must handle all necessary conversions for the database.

   On errors, the functions must throw an ex-info with an error ring
   response.  This simplifies the logic and code of the client using this
   protocol."

    "This function adds the given resource to the database.  The resource
     must not already exist in the database.

     On success, the function must return a 201 ring response with the
     relative URL of the new resource as the Location.

     On failure, the function must throw an ex-info containing the error
     ring response.  The error must be 409 (conflict) if the resource
     exists already.  Other appropriate error codes can also be thrown.")
