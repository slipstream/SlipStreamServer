;;
;; Currently the dynamic loading of a resource depends on the existence (or
;; absence) of particular vars.
;;
;; When grouping the functionality into one or more protocols, there will
;; still need to be a "magic" function or var within the resource's namespace
;; that acts as a hook to pull the resource into the web application.
;;
;; Two alternatives are:
;;
;;   * A no-arg function that reifies an instance of the resource or
;;   * A var (probably using delay) that contains a singleton instance.
;;
;; The name of the function/var would have to be defined by convention.
;;

;;
;; Common implementations of functions are currently put into a separate
;; namespace and then referenced explicitly from the resource implementations.
;; Probably it will make sense to continue doing this when switching to
;; protocols, but there is also the possibility of extending Object with the
;; default implementations to avoid having to make explicit references in
;; every resource definition.

(defprotocol IResource
  "Collection of functions to be implemented by a web resource"

  ;;
  ;; These functions are currently implemented as compile-time constants
  ;; The code that dynamically loads the resources, checks for the existence
  ;; of these constants when "linking" the resource into the web application
  ;; routing.  The constants are also use when generating the resource
  ;; representations.
  ;;
  ;; These resources could be replaced with conventions that generate the
  ;; necessary values from the last element of the resource's namespace.
  ;; E.g. from the 'com.sixsq.slipstream.ssclj.resources.connector-template'
  ;; namespace, the following values could be inferred:
  ;;
  ;;  * resource-name = 'ConnectorTemplate'
  ;;  * collection-name = 'ConnectorTemplateCollection'
  ;;  * resource-url = 'connector-template'
  ;;  * resource-tag = 'ConnectorTemplates'
  ;;  * resource-uri = '<prefix>/ConnectorTemplate'
  ;;  * collection-uri = '<prefix>/ConnectorTemplateCollection'
  ;;
  ;; If convention is used, then special cases may need to be taken care of
  ;; for irregular plural forms or for cases like the CloudEntryPoint where
  ;; there is no associated collection.

    "Provides the Pascal-case name of the collection for this resource. This
     is usually just the resource name of the resource with 'Collection'
     appended (e.g. ConnectorTemplateCollection). Not all resources have an
     associated collection (e.g. CloudEntryPoint).")
