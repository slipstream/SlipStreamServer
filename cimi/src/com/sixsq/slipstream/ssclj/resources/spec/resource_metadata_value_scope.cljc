;; FIXME: This function shouldn't be necessary!
;; There is a problem when using the ::value-scope spec directly in the
;; s/map-of expression in st/spec.  Validation throws an exception when
;; trying to validate against single-value or collection-item.  Hiding
;; the details behind this function works, but clearly isn't ideal for
;; error reporting. The reason for the problem needs to be determined
;; and either worked around or fixed.
