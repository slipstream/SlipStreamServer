The Cloud Entry Point (CEP) provides a list of all CIMI resource (document)
collections available from this server instance. See the general information
about the service below. Detailed metadata for each collection (and for some
resource templates) can be found in the ResourceMetadata collection.

# CIMI API

The [Cloud Infrastructure Management
Interface](https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0263_2.0.0.pdf)
(CIMI) specification from DMTF describes a uniform, extensible, RESTful (HTTP)
API for the management of cloud resources.

As CIMI's underlying resource model closely resembles the existing
SlipStream resource model and simplifies use of the API through
standard patterns and autodiscovery, the SlipStream developers have
decided to adopt this standard.

> NOTE: All of the resources rooted at '/api' follow the CIMI resource
management patterns. These are marked with 'CIMI' in the table of contents.


## Autodiscovery

The CIMI API has been designed to allow for automatic discovery of the
supported resources and management operations.

### Resource Directory

```shell
# Cloud Entry Point (directory of resources)
curl https://nuv.la/api/cloud-entry-point
```

```json
{
  \"id\" : \"cloud-entry-point\",
  \"resourceURI\" : \"http://schemas.dmtf.org/cimi/2/CloudEntryPoint\",
  \"created\" : \"2016-06-21T17:31:14.950Z\",
  \"updated\" : \"2016-06-21T17:31:14.950Z\",

  \"baseURI\" : \"https://nuv.la/api/\",

  \"connectors\" : {
    \"href\" : \"connector\"
  },
  \"accountingRecords\" : {
    \"href\" : \"accounting-record\"
  },

  \"other fields\" : \"...\"
}
```

The primary directory of resources is the **Cloud Entry Point** (CEP),
which contains a list of named resource collections and their URLs (in
the `href` field) relative to the `baseURI` value.  The CEP also
contains some other metadata.

> WARNING: Although SlipStream maintains consistent naming throughout the API,
assumptions about the URL naming must not be made by clients. Clients must use
the CEP to discover the correct URLs for managed resources.

### Operations

If the user is authorized to perform various management operations on
a resource, the resource will contain an 'operations' key.  The value
of the key will contain a list of actions (e.g. `add`, `edit`,
`delete`, `start`) along with the URL to use to execute the action.

The HTTP methods to use for the CIMI `add`, `edit`, and `delete`
operations are POST, PUT, and DELETE, respectively.  All other
operations use the HTTP POST method.

## Resource Management (CRUD)

The CIMI standard defines patterns for all of the usual database
actions: Search (or Query), Create, Read, Update, and Delete (SCRUD),
although the specification uses 'Add' for 'Create' and 'Edit' for
'Update'.

**See Section 4.2.1 of the CIMI specification for detailed
descriptions of these patterns.**  Only differences from the standard
patterns are documented here.

### HTTP Methods

The following table shows the mapping between the resource management
action and the HTTP method to be used. **Those resources *with* a CIMI
notation follow the CIMI patterns.**

Action | HTTP Method | URL
------ | ----------- | ---
Search | `GET` or `PUT` | resource collection
Add (create) | `POST` | resource collection
Read | `GET` | resource
Edit (update) | `PUT` | resource
Delete | `DELETE` | resource
Other | `POST` | operation URL

> NOTE: Specialized actions can appear in the operations section of a
resource. Any non-standard operation will use the POST method for the request.
The parameters (if any) will depend on the operation.


### Add Pattern Variations

Note that there are two CIMI add (create) patterns:

 * **Direct creation** that takes uses the new resource's content
   directly in the creation request, and

 * **Templated creation** that uses a template to create the resource.

In the Cloud Entry Point, **any resource that has a corresponding
template resource will use the templated add pattern**. For example,
the Session resource will use the templated add pattern because there
is a SessionTemplate resource also listed.

## Resource Selection

The CIMI specification provides advanced features for selecting
resources when searching collections, including paging (CIMI Section
4.1.6.2), subsetting (4.1.6.3), sorting (4.1.6.6), and filtering
(4.1.6.1).

All of the resource selection parameters are specified as HTTP query
parameters.  These are specified directly within the URL when using
the HTTP `GET` method.  They are specified in a body with the media
type of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` when using the `PUT`
method. (Note that use of `PUT` for searches is an SlipStream
extension to the CIMI standard.)

> WARNING: All of the CIMI query parameters are prefixed with a dollar sign
($). This was an unfortunate choice because it signals variable interpolation
in most shells. When using these parameters at the command line, be sure to
escape the dollar signs or to put the parameters within single quotes.

### Ordering

The results can be ordered by the values of fields within the
resources.  The general form of a query with ordering is:

`$orderby=attributeName[:asc|:desc], ...`

The ascending (:asc, default) or descending (:desc) field is
optional.  The sorting is done using the natural order of the field
values. Multiple `$orderby` parameters are allowed, in which case
resources are sorted by the first attribute, then equal values are
sorted by the second attribute, etc.

### Paging

A range of resources can be obtained by setting the `$first` and
`$last` (1-based) query parameters.  The values default to the first
and last resources, respectively, in the collection if explicit values
are not provided.

> NOTE: The SlipStream implementation will limit the number of returned
resources to 10000, independently of the values provided for these parameters.
This is to protect both the client and server from excessively large responses.

> NOTE: The selection of resources via these parameters is done after any
filtering and ordering.

### Subsetting

Using the `$select` parameter allows you to select only certain
attributes to be returned by the server.  Avoiding sending information
that will not be useful reduces the load on the network and the
server.

Multiple attributes may be specified by providing a string with
comma-separated values or with multiple `$select` parameters.

> NOTE: For various reasons, the server may return attributes that you have
not selected in the responses. The server should always return the selected
attributes.

Example select values:

```c
name,description
```

### Filtering

Example filters:

```c
((alpha>2) and (beta>='bad value') or (nested/value!=false)
```

```c
((property['alpha']=\"OK\") or (missing=null))
```

The CIMI specification defines a simple, but powerful, filtering
language to make sophisticated selections of resources. (See Section
4.1.6.1 of the full [CIMI
specification](https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0263_2.0.0.pdf).)
The syntax of the `$filter` query parameter consists of infix binary
comparisons combined with `and` or `or` operators. Parentheses can be
used to force the ordering of operations.  Whitespace is ignored.

The following tables list the supported relational operators and
types. All comparisons use the natural ordering of the data type.

operator | description
-------- | -----------
= | equal
!= | not equal
< | less than
<= | less than or equal
> | greater than
>= | greater than or equal
^= | starts with (SlipStream extension)

type | comment
---- | -------
integer | integer values
string | single or double-quoted strings
date | date in ISO8601 format
boolean | either true or false
null | null values (SlipStream extension)

The SlipStream filtering implementation is a superset of the CIMI
filtering specification.  These extentions include:

 - The arguments for binary operators can be specified in either order
   (attribute, value or value, attribute).
 - 'null' is supported as a literal value to allow the
   existence/non-existence of a value to be determined.
 - A 'prefix' or 'starts with' operator ('^=') is supported. This was
   judged to be generally useful and was easy to implement for
   Elasticsearch.
 - Nested attributes are supported with levels separated by slashes
   ('/'). This syntax is used elsewhere in the CIMI standard, but not
   specifically mentioned in the filter specification.

The filter syntax may be extended in the future to also support the
'not' logical operation.

The [full
grammar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slipstream/SlipStreamServer/master/cimi/resources/com/sixsq/slipstream/ssclj/filter/cimi-filter-grammar.txt)
of our extended CIMI filtering is documented in GitHub.


### Aggregations

The SlipStream CIMI implementation also allows users to aggregate
values over a set of filtered documents.  This is useful for providing
summary information concerning a set of documents, such as the sum of
an attribute, average, etc.

The general form of a query with an aggregation is:

`$aggregation=algorithm:attributeName, ...`

Multiple aggregation expressions can be provided.  The results of
these calculations are provided in the 'aggregations' section of the
response. The supported aggregations are described in the following
table.

algorithm | description
--------- | -----------
min | minimum value
max | maximum value
sum | sum of values
avg | average of values
stats | statistics of values
extendedstats | extended statistics of values
count | number of values/documents
percentiles | binned percentiles of values
cardinality | cardinality of a field
missing | number of documents with missing field
terms | histogram of values and counts

## Deviations

SlipStream does not (yet) provide a complete implementation of the
CIMI API and out of necessity deviates in several ways from the
standard.

### Media Types

The CIMI standard mandates the support of both XML and JSON.  **The
SlipStream implementation only supports JSON** (and in some cases
URL-encoded forms).

### Authorization

The CIMI standard does not mandate any authentication and
authorization process. The schema of all resources in the SlipStream
implementation includes an 'acl' key.  **The Access Control List (ACL)
of each resource describes who is authorized to manage that
resource.**

### Searches

The CIMI standard only provides for searches over resource collections
with the HTTP `GET` method.  Because those filters can be quite long,
there can be issues with the length of the `GET` URL. Consequently,
SlipStream clients may also **search resource collections using the
HTTP `PUT` method** with a body containing the filters (and other
parameters) as a URL-encoded form.

### Aggregations

As described earlier, SlipStream extends the CIMI standard to also
include aggregating values over a collection of resources.
